Since the dinosaur is described as slow, this could mean that it is indeed lazy.\n\nOn the other hand, we know that all fierce animals are strong. Since the leopard is described as big and awful, this suggests that it is fierce. Therefore, the leopard cannot be both fierce and slow, which means that the dinosaur must be either slow or fast (since it cannot be both).\n\nSince the context does not provide any information about the speed of the dinosaur, we cannot definitively say whether it is lazy or not.

From the fact \"If something is asleep and dull then it is slow\", we can deduce that if the dinosaur is asleep and dull, it must be slow.\n2. However, from the fact \"If something is sleepy then it chases the cat\", we know that if the dinosaur is sleepy, it will chase the cat. This contradicts our previous deduction that the dinosaur is slow.\n3.
